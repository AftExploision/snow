# Example Project

[src/main.c](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/main.c)
is the main program, which runs `snow_main()` if testing is enabled.

[src/vector.c](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/vector.c)
contains both the implementation of vectors, and the implementation's test
suite.
